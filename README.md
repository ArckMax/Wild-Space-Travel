We have created this app with Angular CLI version 6.1.5, and using NASA API, in the context of our developer training 
 at  WILD CODE SCHOOL La Loupe (FR)

We have decided to build a fiction-related application, that could actually one day become a real product ! For now we 
are willing to continue and enhance the app, but here's the very first version.
 
We hope you will enjoy the trip, don't hesitate to contact us for further informations,
